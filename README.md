# crow-max
Max + M4L for crow (monome/whimsical raps)

## Max installation
After downloading the entire `crow-max` repo, extract the zip file and you should get two unique folders: `crow_max` and `crow_m4l`.

nb. Max installation is **not** required to use the devices in `crow_m4l`.

Open `Max` > `Options` > `File Preferences` > highlight `User Library` > the rightmost icon in the bottom bar should illuminate. Clicking this icon will open the User Library folder, where you can drop the `crow_max` folder.

If you are performing an update of an existing `crow_max` installation, you can simply allow the system to replace the existing files. If you somehow have previous **beta** crow files in your User Library (or anywhere along your Max search path), please delete them and start fresh with `crow_max`.

Restart Max and you should be able to instantiate the `crow` object!

## Max for Live installation
Open Live (9 or 10) Suite, running at least Max 7.3.6.

After downloading the `crow_m4l` folder, place it wherever you'd prefer on your harddrive. Open Live and drag the folder into Live's browser, under `PLACES`.

If you are updating a previous installation, just replace the previous `crow_m4l` folder's contents with the new files.
